Started in my HTML file and started with the heading tag. (h1, h3)
Center those two in CSS with text-align under body.
Found a dog image and made it into a class under div.
// Had an issue adding the pic and it was because I wrote scr instead of src.
I was able to center a div element

Start with one button

An element on the page that dispalys 0

When the button is clicked, the number increments by 1.
