Thanks for taking a look at my Tamagotchi Game. 
The goal is to keep me alive. 

To begin: You 1st click on the first prompt and name your dog.

The fun part begins where you have to keep Your dog alive!
How to do that:
We click Start.
The counter will start. The count up will begin. As the numbers go up we click on the corresponding buttons. 

1. The "feed" button corresponds to the Hunger watch.
2. The "Turn of the Lights" its time to sleep, so rest.
3. The "Play" button is for my "Bore" count.

So when feed goes up one, you click on it to keep it down, and so forth This counter goes up simultaneously, it's up to you to keep it down!

As you can see my age goes up every 1 minutes (they must think I am a cat with 9 lives!)




While doing all this please don't let my count reach 10 or I will die xxx ;(
